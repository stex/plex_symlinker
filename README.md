# PlexSymlinker

This gem allows creating a Plex-friendly folder structure with symlinks for your audio books.  
All you need are audio files with correct tagging, the gem takes care of making Plex understand them without you having to change the way you're organising your files.

**The Problem**

Most of my audio files are in apple's `m4b` format, leaving me with one file per book most of the times:

    📁 audiobooks
     ∟ 📁 author name
        ∟ book1.m4b
        ∟ book2.m4b

The problem with this structure is that Plex' music agent doesn't quite understand it.  
Even though the files are properly tagged with author, album, etc., Plex tends to create a giant
album out of all the files inside - often with the first audio book as album name.

What the Plex music agent expects is a structure like this:

    📁 audiobooks
     ∟ 📁 author name
        ∟ 📁 Book 1
           ∟ book1.m4b
        ∟ 📁 Book 2
           ∟ book2.m4b

This would mean that I'd have to introduce single-file-directories into my structure which didn't really make
sense for me - especially as I have a lot of "Hörspiele" (mostly german format of short audio books with multiple
actors + music).

**This gem's solution**

`plex_symlinker` creates symlinks pointing to your actual audio files in exactly the structure Plex' music agent
expects to find. It uses the embedded tags in your files to build it, so even one big directory with
all your audio files in it would work as expected.

Just point plex to the symlink directory instead of your actual files and you're good to go.
